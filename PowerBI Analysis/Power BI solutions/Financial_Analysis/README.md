## Project Overview
This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze employee demographics, performance metrics, promotion rates, turnover, and hiring patterns. It aims to help HR and management make data-driven decisions to improve diversity, talent retention, and employee satisfaction.

## Objective
The key objectives of this dashboard are:
- Analyze gender distribution, promotions, and hiring patterns.
- Monitor employee turnover and performance ratings.
- Aid in strategic workforce management.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Employee ID**: Unique employee identifier.
- **Gender**: Gender of the employee (Male/Female).
- **Hire Date**: Date of employee's hire.
- **Promotion Date**: Last promotion date.
- **Status**: Active or Leaver.
- **Performance Rating**: Employeeâ€™s performance score.
- **Department**: Department of the employee.

## Key Metrics and DAX Calculations

1. **Number of Men**:
    ```DAX
    NumberOfMen = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('EmployeeTable'), 'EmployeeTable'[Gender] = "Male")
    ```

2. **Number of Women**:
    ```DAX
    NumberOfWomen = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('EmployeeTable'), 'EmployeeTable'[Gender] = "Female")
    ```

3. **Number of Leavers**:
    ```DAX
    NumberOfLeavers = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('EmployeeTable'), 'EmployeeTable'[Status] = "Leaver")
    ```

4. **% of Employees Promoted (FY21)**:
    ```DAX
    EmployeesPromotedFY21 = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('EmployeeTable'), 'EmployeeTable'[PromotionDate] >= DATE(2021,1,1), 'EmployeeTable'[PromotionDate] <= DATE(2021,12,31))
    PercentagePromotedFY21 = DIVIDE(EmployeesPromotedFY21, TotalEmployees) * 100
    ```

5. **% of Women Promoted**:
    ```DAX
    WomenPromoted = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('EmployeeTable'), 'EmployeeTable'[PromotionDate] >= DATE(2021,1,1), 'EmployeeTable'[Gender] = "Female")
    PercentageWomenPromoted = DIVIDE(WomenPromoted, TotalEmployees) * 100
    ```
