## **Project Objective**

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Analyze stock market data using RSI, EMA, and SMA.

- Perform time series forecasting to predict stock price movements.

- Identify high-performing stocks and potential buy/sell signals.

- Visualize the results in Power BI for interactive exploration and insights.

## **Data Description**

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- **Date:** The date of stock activity.

- **Open:** The opening price of the stock.

- **High:** The highest price recorded during the day.

- **Low:** The lowest price recorded during the day.

- **Close:** The closing price of the stock.

- **Name:** The stock's name.

## **Analysis Process**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Handled missing or inconsistent data.
  
   - Formatted the date column and ensured all data was clean for analysis.
   
### 2. **Indicator Calculations:**

   - **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Calculated for each stock to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
    
   - **EMA (Exponential Moving Average):** Calculated to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends.
    
   - **SMA (Simple Moving Average):** Used for comparison with EMA to spot long-term trends.

### 3. **Time Series Forecasting:**

   - Built a time series model using historical data to forecast future stock prices.

### 4. **Visualizations in Power BI:**

   - Created interactive dashboards to visualize stock performance, trends, and buy/sell signals.
    
   - Visuals include line charts, bar charts, and KPI indicators to track key metrics.
